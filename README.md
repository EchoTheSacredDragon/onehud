# About
OneHUD is a modern, stylistic HUD themed around Battlefield 1 and Battlefield V. Flat colors and a simple layout make the hud easy on the eyes and makes customization a breeze.

# Installation
Copy the `onehud-main` file from the zip you downloaded into the `/tf/custom/` directory.

# Customization
In OneHUD, you can select a custom crosshair and you can also enable a hitmarker. The crosshair can be selected in `hudlayout.res` and the hitmarker can be toggled on or off in `hudplayerclass.res`.

Colors are also easily customized in the `colors.res` file.
